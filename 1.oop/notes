OOP

1. Abstraction
    Users need to know what the system does 
    and not how the system does it

    Simplify

    Interface is object behaviors you expose to the outside world
    so your users can effectively use the system.

2. Encapsulation

    Protect system for being abused

    Think of a Car radio interface
    a. what all does it do.
    b. how does it do it

    Radio.java
